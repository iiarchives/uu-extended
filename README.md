# UU-Matter Extended

Ever thought UU-Matter was way too lame? Neither did I.  
UU-Matter Extended adds new recipes for the following mods:
- Vanilla Minecraft (slimeball, wool, blaze rods, ...)
- [Ad Astra](https://modrinth.com/mod/ad-astra) (ostrum ore and deepslate variant, ...)
- [Applied Energistics 2](https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2) (certus quartz, ...)
